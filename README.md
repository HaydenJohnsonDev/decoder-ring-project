# decoder ring project
In this project I used Javascript to write the sorting algorithms for the site's functionality. 
## purpose
The purpose of this project was to challenge my ability to use native array methods to manipulate data in a variety of ways.
The result is a robust algorithm that can encode and decode the same message in a variety of ways that the user may decide.
